  <!-- Description -->
  <p class="mb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">
    Juna is a 60% keyboard design inspired by the OTD 360c, created to deliver a
    classic, stiff mounting experience.

  <p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">
    It was one of the first keyboards I designed and reflects my appreciation
    for rigid, traditional mounting styles.

    The board draws its theme from Clairo’s Charm album, carrying that influence
    through its overall aesthetic direction.
